# Summary: GitHub Copilot + OMS Knowledge Base Integration

## üéØ What We Accomplished

Your MCP knowledge server is **fully operational** and configured to make GitHub Copilot use your OMS specifications when writing code, tests, and doing analysis/refactoring.

---

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### MCP Server
- ‚úÖ **Running** and serving 9 OMS specification documents
- ‚úÖ **6 MCP tools** available to GitHub Copilot:
  1. `listDomainDocs` - List all spec files
  2. `readDomainDoc` - Read full documents
  3. `searchDomainDocs` - Search across all docs
  4. `listDocSections` - Get document outlines
  5. `readDocSection` - Read specific sections
  6. `searchDocSections` - Section-level search

### Your Spec Library
Located in `/home/tbaderts/data/workspace/oms/specs/`:
- oms_spec.md (10 KB) - Main specification
- domain-model_spec.md (4.4 KB) - Domain model details
- state-query-store_spec.md (10.7 KB) - State store design
- streaming_spec.md (13.8 KB) - Streaming architecture
- software-architecture-methodology_spec.md (10.1 KB) - Methodology
- manifesto.md (7.4 KB) - Team manifesto
- skill_profiles.md (10.9 KB) - Skill profiles
- oms_future_considerations.md (18.3 KB) - Future plans
- todo.txt (311 B) - TODOs

### Configuration
- ‚úÖ `application.yml` configured with correct spec path
- ‚úÖ JAR rebuilt with latest configuration
- ‚úÖ MCP server connected to GitHub Copilot

## üöÄ How to Use It

### The Core Pattern (Use This Every Time)

**Step 1: Ask Copilot to Read Specs**
```
@workspace Search specs for "[CONCEPT]"
```

**Step 2: Generate or Analyze**
```
@workspace Based on the spec, generate [CODE]
```

**Step 3: Validate**
```
@workspace Does this match the spec requirements?
```

### Example Prompts to Try Now

**Understand your domain:**
```
@workspace What does the OMS spec say about state machines?
```

**Create new code:**
```
@workspace Using the OMS spec, create the Execution entity class with spec references
```

**Write tests:**
```
@workspace Generate comprehensive tests for Order state transitions based on the State Machine spec
```

**Analyze existing code:**
```
@workspace Analyze OrderService.java against the OMS specifications and report compliance
```

**Refactor:**
```
@workspace Refactor our validation code to use the predicate-based pattern from the spec
```

## üí° Key Principles

### Always:
1. ‚úÖ Start with `@workspace` to give Copilot access to MCP tools
2. ‚úÖ Reference specific specs in your prompts
3. ‚úÖ Ask Copilot to cite specs in generated code
4. ‚úÖ Include spec references in code comments
5. ‚úÖ Validate generated code against specs

### Never:
1. ‚ùå Assume Copilot knows your specs without asking
2. ‚ùå Write domain code without checking specs first
3. ‚ùå Skip spec references in PRs
4. ‚ùå Use generic prompts for domain-specific code

---

## üéØ Quick Wins to Try Today

### 1. Explore Your Knowledge Base
```
@workspace List all available domain docs
```

### 2. Understand a Concept
```
@workspace Read the Domain Model section from the OMS spec and explain the core entities
```

### 3. Generate Something Useful
```
@workspace Create OrderState enum with all states from the spec, with Javadoc explaining each state
```

### 4. Validate Dependencies
```
@workspace Check if our build.gradle matches the Technology Stack from oms_spec.md
```

## üìä Benefits You'll See

### For Development
- **Faster onboarding** - New devs can query specs via Copilot
- **Consistent code** - All code follows the same spec patterns
- **Better quality** - Copilot helps enforce spec requirements
- **Less context switching** - No need to leave IDE to read specs

### For Code Reviews
- **Spec traceability** - Every class links to its spec requirements
- **Automated validation** - Ask Copilot to check spec compliance
- **Reduced debates** - Spec is the source of truth
- **Better PRs** - Include spec references automatically

### For Testing
- **Complete coverage** - Tests map to spec requirements

## üîß Configuration Details

### MCP Server Configuration
**File:** `mcp-server-lib/src/main/resources/application.yml`
```yaml
domain:
  docs:
    paths: /home/tbaderts/data/workspace/oms/specs
```

### GitHub Copilot MCP Config
**File:** `~/.config/github-copilot/mcp.json`
- MCP server is registered as "oms"
- Automatically started by Copilot
- Uses stdio transport

### Building
```bash
cd /home/tbaderts/data/workspace/mcp-server-lib
./gradlew bootJar -x test
```

### Reloading
After config changes:
1. Rebuild: `./gradlew bootJar`
2. Reload VS Code window (Ctrl+Shift+P ‚Üí "Developer: Reload Window")

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**MCP tools not showing?**
```
@workspace What MCP tools are available?
```
Should show all 6 tools. If not, reload VS Code.

**Empty spec list?**
```
@workspace Call listDomainDocs
```
Should return 9 documents. If empty, check application.yml path.

**Copilot not using specs?**
- You must explicitly ask with `@workspace`
- Reference specs in your prompts
- Use examples from COPILOT_PROMPTS_LIBRARY.md

---

## üéâ You're All Set!

Everything is configured and ready to use. Your OMS specifications are now **active participants** in your development workflow through GitHub Copilot.
