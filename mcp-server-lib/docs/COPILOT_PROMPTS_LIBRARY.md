## üí° Pro Tips

### Combine Multiple Prompts
You can chain these prompts:

**Step 1:** Understand the spec
```
@workspace Explain what the spec says about validation
```

**Step 2:** Analyze current code
```
@workspace Compare our validation code against the spec
```

**Step 3:** Refactor
```
@workspace Refactor our validation to match the spec pattern
```

**Step 4:** Test
```
@workspace Generate tests for the refactored validation
```

### Save Time with Templates

Create your own templates by replacing placeholders:
- `[ENTITY]` - Order, Execution, Quote, QuoteRequest
- `[PATTERN]` - CQRS, Event Sourcing, State Machine
- `[SECTION]` - Domain Model, Technology Stack, etc.

---

## üìù Remember

**Every prompt should:**
1. ‚úÖ Start with reading/searching specs
2. ‚úÖ Reference specific spec sections
3. ‚úÖ Ask for spec citations in output
4. ‚úÖ Use `@workspace` for MCP tool access
5. ‚úÖ Be specific about what you want

**The magic formula:**
```
@workspace 
1. Read/search specs for [TOPIC]
2. [ACTION] based on spec requirements
3. Include spec references in output
```

Happy spec-driven coding! üöÄ
